 ./How to Build (NOAH"S UPDATED FANCY CODE)

------------
You only need to do this once. The galaxy DB file can be changed without rebuilding.

1. > cmake
2. > make

it's built now, so need to run like this: 

***************************************************************
LCM$./build/KDFit3e n7814 DB/galaxiesXueSofue.db test.pdf
*********************

****************
if edit PARAMETERS (to revise bounds etc.)  in KDFit3e or in the $cout$ statements in CalcH.cc, 
then need to go into LCM/build$make
*********************


HOW TO MAKE LUM PICS Added 2.6.14 sofia:
1.use excel spread sheet MilkyWayLUMmassmodels.xlsc(or whatever extension is..) to make reduced rotation velocity 
from quadrature sum of gas and stars. 
2.make .txt file of radius and velocity, name MW_Lum_author.txt
3.edit LUM_MWmassmodels.c to include new milky way
4. in root, .x LUM_MWmassmodels.c
will run
*********************



How to Run
----------
1. Prepare your galaxy DB file (see instructions below). The default name used is "galaxies.db"; if you want to use a different filename, you'll need to specify it when you run the program (next step).
2. > ./ReadGalaxy [options]
   Available Options
    * -g [galaxy label] -- required -- specifies the galaxy used
    * -d [galaxy db file] -- optional [galaxies.db] -- specifies the galaxy DB file used
    * -c [constant] -- optional [1.0] -- scales the luminous matter distribution


How to Prepare a Galaxy DB File
-------------------------------
 - Galaxy DB files are text files that are read at run-time, so you do not need to rebuild after changing the DB file.
 - Each galaxy should be specified on a single line.
 - Blank lines are allowed.
 - Entire lines can be commented by starting the line with a pound symbol (#).
 - A galaxy line is made up of space-separated tokens; a token consists of a name and value separated by an equals sign; Name=Value.  There should be no spaces within a token, and quotation marks should be avoided.
 - Each galaxy must have a token specifying the label (e.g. Label=N230895)
 - The other tokens specify the filenames to be read/create files. The available token names are:
     Lum=[luminous matter file]
     Bulge=[bulge file]
     Disc=[disc file]
     Gas=[gas file]
     Data=[data file]
     DataError=[data error file]
     Out=[output file]
 - The Milky Way should have either a Lum token or a combination of Bulge, Disc, and Gas tokens.
 - All other galaxies should have either a Lum token or a combination of Bulge, Disc, and Gas tokens, plus all three of the Data, DataError, and Out tokens.
 - Duplicate token names are ignored. Only the first token with a given name will be used.

TO MAKE NFW OR MOND FITS: 
need to hand edit the chi-square file to add a 7th column, 
which is the model predictions at the specified radius. 
Do this in an excel file, 
same the name of the updated chi-square file (append MODELedits.txt)
and run in root. Won't be a picture we want to save, 
so make sure has a different name than the one we use in the code. 
***************
Added 2.20.14 sofia
to run galaxies in terminal window, go to the correct directory, 
$ make
$./ReadGalaxy -g galname -d galaxiesSpecify.db -c scalingValue


Once Chisquare file is made, 
$root
[].L KDfit2e.c
[]KDFit2("chisquareFilename.txt","output.eps")
